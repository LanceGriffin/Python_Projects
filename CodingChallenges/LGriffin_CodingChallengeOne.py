#Q 1: The difference between a int and a float is that an int is a whole number, while a float is a decimal number. Example: 5 is an int, 5.1 is a float.
#Q 2: Python doesn't require variable declarations, because it is a dynamically typed language.
#Q 3: If {Age} was a string, it would be enclosed in quotes.
